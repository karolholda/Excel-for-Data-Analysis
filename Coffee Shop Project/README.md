## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning Story

The dataset required extensive cleaning to ensure accuracy and usability. Hereâ€™s how I approached the challenges:

1. **Date Formatting Issues**  
   - Dates were provided in inconsistent formats (`MM/DD/YYYY`, `DD-MM-YYYY`, and text like "July 23rd"). 
   - Used Excelâ€™s `DATEVALUE` and `TEXT` functions to standardize all dates to a single format, making them usable for time-series analysis.

2. **Duplicates and Inconsistencies**  
   - Detected and removed duplicate entries using Excelâ€™s `Remove Duplicates` feature.
   - Corrected product name inconsistencies (e.g., "Large Coffee" vs. "Coffee Large") using a combination of `VLOOKUP` and manual review.

3. **Missing Values in Payment Method**  
   - Many transactions had missing payment type information. 
   - Filled missing values using logical patterns, such as assuming "Online" for large transactions and imputing the most frequent payment method for smaller ones.

4. **Data Validation**  
   - Applied data validation rules to ensure all future entries adhered to consistent formats, particularly for product names and payment methods.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Findings

- **Popular Products**: Strong and medium-strength coffees in larger sizes were the most purchased.
- **Regional Trends**: Sales peaked in countries with colder climates, indicating seasonal consumption patterns.
- **Loyalty Success**: Customers with loyalty cards showed increased purchasing frequency and higher average spend.
- **Seasonality**: December and July consistently had the highest sales, suggesting opportunities for targeted promotions.
- **Dynamic Insights**: The timeline slider revealed clear growth patterns and peak periods.
